adds dummy textbox to oobabooga web_ui

https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui

The box automatically saves anything you write or paste in it to file keep.txt in text-generation-webui
And read it back next time you run it. Works in all interface mode - especially useful in --notebook 

The extension can be installed by cloning this repository inside the ../text-generation-webui/extensions folder:

cd PATH_TO_text-generation-webui/extensions

git clone https://github.com/FartyPants/dummy_box
